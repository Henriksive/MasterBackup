\section{Symmetric-key Cryptography}
\subsection{Description and Motivation}
We want to discover the encryption abilities on the smart card and decide if it is feasible to let the smart card handle the encryption of confidential data. From the smart card documentation we know that we are able to use AES to encrypt data, but we do not know how long it will take to encrypt the data. We will need to perform a running time tests with different amounts of data in order to determine the performance of the smart card.

\subsection{Test setup}
The framework we are using is designed around extended APDU and the test platform we have designed in javacard utilizes extended APDU. As a result we are not able to use the micro SD cards (as described in section \ref{sec:limitationsMSD}) and we will be using the NFC smart cards.

The encryption algorithm we will use is AES cipher algorithm with block chaining (CBC). The current version of javacard
