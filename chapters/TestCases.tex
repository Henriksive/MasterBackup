\chapter{Test Cases}
In this chapter we will perform tests on the smart card regarding cryptographic performance and proof of concept implementation to evaluate the proposed solutions from the previous chapter. The tests will help us determine if smart cards are a valuable addition to mobile security or if they lack the power to function properly in a mobile device environment.
