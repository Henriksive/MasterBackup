This master thesis developed and tested the idea that smart cards are able to help mitigate security threats on mobile devices that are handling sensitive data. Investigating the limitations of smart cards is a fundamental part of the idea and we performed in-depth testing and analysis of what smart cards are capable of. Our study shows that smart cards are limited by their low processing power, low amount of memory and a severely lacking application programming language. These limitations affect smart cards usefulness concerning cryptography and data processing.

Despite the limitations smart cards can still be a useful asset as they offer a secure environment that are tamper resistant. Viable use cases include secure key management, secure key storage, digital signing and cryptography with small amounts of data. The viable use cases are often a basis for more complex use cases and we are certain that smart cards improve their integrity and security.

Even though we were able to construct an Android library and smart card application for secure communication, there still remains research on the topic. We were not able to implement all the functionality we wanted. Future work may include full scale testing of our framework, additional development and testing on more technological advanced smart cards.
